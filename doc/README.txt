----------------------

I.Introduction
  EvolvedIRC is trying to bring a new kind of breed of IRC Chat Client to the End User.
  (Sorry if the introduction is a bit short at this time but I do not like writing documents)

II.Installation
  Currently there is no installation program so just extract the eIRC.exe file to 
  C:\Program Files\EvolvedIRC\

III.Connecting
  Currently there is no way for you to connect to any server other then Freenode.Net that is because there 
  is no configuration file were you can change the server you connect to. 
  But the /join command work but with a flaw you don't leave the current room your in we are trying our 
  best to fix this but can't as we need to get the rest of the commands in and format the incoming raw 
  irc messages to show up as:

  <EvolvedIRC|Test> hello
  instead of this:
  :DJ_Dark!~db_host@dj-myth.devolper.evolvedirc PRIVMSG #Evolved-IRC :hi

IV.FAQ
  1.Q:Why doesn't MY own message show up?
    A:Because we haven't fixed that yet, remember this is just a Pre-Alpha/Alpha.
  2.Q:Why am I in two channels?
    A:Because we haven't fixed that yet and we are working on it at the moment.
